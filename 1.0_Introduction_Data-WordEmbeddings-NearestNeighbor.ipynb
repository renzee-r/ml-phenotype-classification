    "## Phenotype Classification of Electronic Health Records\n",
    "\n",
    "Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is a rapidly growing source of unstructured biomedical data. This data is extremely rich, often capturing a patientâ€™s phenotype. In a clinical context, phenotype refers to the medical conditions, diseases, and disorders of a patient. These records can capture data in higher detail compared to structured encodings such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Traditional methods for extracting phenotypes from this data typically relies on manual review or processing the data through rule-based expert systems. Both approaches are time intensive, rely heavily on human expertise, and scale poorly. This project proposes an automated approach to identifying phenotypes in EHR data through machine learning.\n"

    "Typically these vectors are trained on extremely large corpora, which can take a lot of time and resources. Thankfully, the word embedding space is quite mature and there exists pre-trained models, ready to use out of the box. One such model is Standford's GloVe vectors, which is trained on a corpus of 6B tokens from Wikipedia and Gigaword. These vectors are available at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. We will go through some exercises to explore word vectors.\n"

    "The goal of this project is to classify Eletronic Health Record (EHR) text. This of course means that we need to get our hands on some EHR data. This can be particularly difficult due to the strict rules and guidelines around healthcare data. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, outlines a set of rules that help protect the privacy of our health information. These rules are vital for building a healthcare system where we can trust our healthcare providers and caregivers, so it is important that we adhere to the standards set by HIPAA. \n",

    "For this project, we will be using a dataset provided by MTSamples.com. They provide ~5,000 transcribed medical reports covering 40 specialty types. All of the notes have been de-identified of protected health information, making them HIPAA compliant. Below we will explore a few rows of the raw data."

    "\n",
    "With the EHR data now loaded, we could technically start applying Machine Learning operations as is. However, text can come in all forms and some models perform better when the input text is in a certain form. We discover a few of these optimizations throughout our ML notebooks, but it would be good to cover them here as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first obstacle is managing our text length. As our input text grows, so does the number of variables and the number of operations. Depending on our algorithm, these values can scale exponentially, causing runtime and resource usage to explode out of hand. To help manage the scope of our input text, we will be breaking up our notes into sentences. Limiting our text length also helps the model focus on the signals that matter. This should give us enough context to learn the more complex relationships between our words while minimizing runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another pre-processing step we can take is to apply basic natural language cleanup techniques that standardize the text and remove non-essential information. Thankfully, python has a package called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) that provides a lot of these transformations as built-in functions. The operations we will use for this project are converting all text to lowercase, removing punctation, filtering out stop words, and removing blanks.\n",

Additionally position of these vectors in relation to eachother also convey word relationships. At the core of it, vectors clustered together are more similar in context and meaning. Using this principle, we can use our categories as anchors in our word embedding, calculate a similarity score for a sentence, and identify which category is the nearest neighbor to our sentence. \n",

    "So as we can see, the results are pretty terrible with an accuracy of 5%. Looking at an example the classifier got right, it relied on words that are exclusively and very distinctly related. However, these strong signals are not always present in our sentences. Looking at an incorrect example, we see how the signals are being drowned out or offset by the other words. This emphasizes the need for some type of model that can learn and weigh the words that provide strong signals for particular categories."
