    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "## Phenotype Classification of Electronic Health Records\n",
    "\n",
    "Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is a rapidly growing source of unstructured biomedical data. This data is extremely rich, often capturing a patient’s phenotype. In a clinical context, phenotype refers to the specific medical condition or disease of a patient. These records captures this data in higher detail compared to structured encodings such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or National Drug Codes (NDC). Traditional methods for extracting phenotypes from this data typically relies on manual review or processing the data through rule-based expert systems. Both approaches are time intensive, rely heavily on human expertise, and scale poorly with increased volume. This project proposes an automated approach to identifying phenotypes in EHR data through word vector clustering and machine learning. An automated approach would greatly reduce time and operation costs, with the potential of even outperforming industry standards. \n",

    "## Word Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of this project is based on word embedding models, an approach that converts words into number vectors based on co-occurence. These vectors help capture word meanings and context in a format suitable for machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically these vectors are trained on extremely large corpora, which can take a lot of time and resources. Thankfully, the word embedding space is quite mature and there exists pre-trained models, ready to use out of the box. One such model is Standford's GloVe vectors, which is trained on a corpus of 6B tokens from Wikipedia and Gigaword. These vectors are available at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. We will go through some exercises to explore word vectors.\n"

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, outlines a set of rules that help protect the privacy of our health information. These rules are vital for building a healthcare system where we can trust our healthcare providers and caregivers, so it is important that we adhere to the standards set by HIPAA. \n",

    "With the EHR data now loaded, we could technically start applying Machine Learning operations as is. However, as with a lot of text-based data, there are a few characteristics that are less than ideal for this project. The first obstacle is managing our text length. As our input text grows, so does the number of variables and the number of operations. Depending on our algorithm, these values can scale exponentially, causing runtime and resource usage to explode out of hand. To help manage the scope of our input text, we will be breaking up our notes into sentences. This should give us enough context to learn the more complex relationships between our words while minimizing runtime. Of course, if we find that runtime performance is not an issue, we can try further expanding our input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another pre-processing step we can take is to apply basic natural language cleanup techniques that standardize the text and remove non-essential information. Thankfully, python has a package called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) that provides a lot of these transformations as built-in functions. The operations we will use for this project are converting all text to lowercase, removing punctation, filtering out stop words, and removing blanks.\n",

Using this principle, we can use our categories as anchors in our word embedding, calculate a similarity score for a sentence, and identify which category is the nearest neighbor to our sentence. \n",

However, these strong signals are not always present in our sentences. Looking at an incorrect example, we see how the signals are being drowned out or offset by the other words. This emphasizes the need for some type of model that can learn and weigh the words that provide strong signals for particular categories."

Maintaining a separate set for testing ensures we avoid overfitting our data.\n",

However, once the models are developed, we will expand our datasets to include all of our data. To ensure we defined our data correctly, we can print a few lines from the two sets."
